                Ndoto Forest Community Conservation Organization is a registered community-based organization in <span className="bold-text">Samburu North </span>sub-county whose main objective is combating climate change through forest conservation, increasing forest cover through afforestation and reforestation within Ndoto Forest and its surrounding community. Ndoto Forest is part of the larger <span className="bold-text">Ngare Ndare</span> ecosystem and is one of the gazetted forests in the larger Samburu County. Ndoto Forest Reserve is gazetted and occupies an area of <span className="bold-text">92,796.321 Hectares</span> . The forest is surrounded by Community Lands of a total acreage of <span className="bold-text">102,779.44 Ha.</span>

                <h2>Why NFCCO</h2>  
                <p className="paragraph paragraph-2">
                The community living around Ndoto Forest saw the need to form a Community forest conservation organization which will seek to protect and conserve the Forest to enable it to improve the environmental, ecological, and socio-economic goods and services that it offers. Though endowed with a rich diversity of resources, the status of Ndoto Forest has continued to deteriorate due to overexploitation of forest resources as a consequence of improper regulation and enforcement of laws to utilize the resources sustainably. This has affected the capacity of the Forest to provide ecological and socio-economic goods and services, hence the need to form a Community forest conservation organization.

                The main project objective is <span className="bold-text">combating climate change </span>through increasing forest cover by planting more trees (afforestation) and introducing other environmental conservation activities in the community that will both conserve the environment and sustainable use of natural resources and generate income for the community surrounding Ndoto Forest who will be part of the conservation activities.
                Moreover, the Community forest conservation organization aims at initiating, complementing, and scaling up conservation programs in the Forest that have a bearing on biodiversity and livelihoods. The immediate objective is to involve the community, KFS, and other relevant stakeholders in the management and conservation of the Forest in realization of the vision.
