                        The semi-literate pastoralists and small-scale farmers surrounding Ndoto Mountain rely heavily on the forest for medicine, water, and livelihoods. Despite their deep indigenous knowledge of local flora, many lack formal education about modern conservation techniques. <br /> <br /> A lot of awareness on the need for conservation of the forest and the ecosystem at large is required as they directly benefit from the forest vegetation.</p>

The community members will be mobilized to meet in a designated location/place for a community meeting where awareness of the organization and its activities will be communicated to them in the meeting. The members will be allowed to air their views on conservation practices of the forest to be incorporated in the organization’s activities.</p>
