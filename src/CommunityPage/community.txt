Intro To Ndoto Community
- Location & Population
The Ndoto Forest Community is situated in Samburu North, Kenya, encompassing the Ndoto and Nyiro forests. This community is dedicated to conserving the ecological integrity of these forests while supporting local livelihoods.

- Need For Sensitization, awareness and mobilization.
The semi-literate pastoralists and small-scale farmers surrounding Ndoto Mountain rely heavily on the forest for medicine, water, and livelihoods. Despite their deep indigenous knowledge of local flora, many lack formal education about modern conservation techniques. A lot of awareness on the need for conservation of the forest and the ecosystem at large is required as they directly benefit from the forest vegetation.


Community Mobilization
Community mobilization – occurs when a community comes together to work towards a common goal. In Ndoto Forest, this will be done through public participation meetings.
The main aim of the public participation meeting is to make the community members to own the project so that they give their best effort and goodwill towards the sustainment of the forest.
We will collaborate with local Chiefs, assistant Chiefs and Nyumba Kumi leaders to reach all households within the communities surrounding Ndoto Forest. The community members will be mobilized to meet in a designated location/place for a community meeting where awareness of the organization and its activities will be communicated to them in the meeting. 
The members will be allowed to air their views on conservation practices of the forest to be incorporated in the organization’s activities.

Community Sensitization And Awareness
We sensitize and make the community aware of the organization's sustainable activities through:
1.Participatory Training Sessions:
   - Workshops on sustainable aloe farming, honey production, and forest-friendly agro-practices.

2. Formation of User Groups:
   - Small, community-led groups will facilitate peer-to-peer learning and streamline training in conservation and income-generating activities. 

3. Community Dialogues:  
   - Regular meetings to discuss forest benefits, climate impacts, and co-create reforestation plans. Indigenous elders will share traditional ecological knowledge to enrich solutions.  

By integrating the community’s heritage with new skills, we can ensure that conservation becomes a shared mission -QUOTED
